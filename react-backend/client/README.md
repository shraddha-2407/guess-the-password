# Guess the password game

## Features

1a. Generates hint by calling `/new-password` [node API]. \
1b. The hint is shuffle of actual 8 digit password stored in `node-cache` \
\
2a. Contains a Form with Input and Submit. \
2b. User enters 8 digit number, which is the added to the game board with highlights on numbers which match the password. \
\
3a. Once the user has guessed the password, the game board shows SUCCESS. \
3b. We also remove the entry from `node-cache` \
\
4a. User Entry is validated against on form submit 
+ Empty entry 
+ Alphanumeric entry 
+ Length less or more than 8 digits. 
+ Entry has duplicate digits. 

5a. When user's entry is valid, `verify-password` is called [node API], which checks if, 
+ password is present in `node-cache` for the hint passed as request object. 
+ If password is not existing, we send back response of 404. 
+ If password is existing, we check user's entry against it, to find the corrects digits.
+ Example: ``` password is '87654321', answer is '86754312', then highlight is ['8','5','4','3'] ```
+ if all the higlights are exactly in same position as password, then user win's the game.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Use only when we are building for production
### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
